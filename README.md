## Notes
Add your notes and top tips here.

## The small print
Enter your details above. Keep your portfolio up to date. You will also store your assignment here.
When you have done an exercise change **-- to do** to **-- completed**.
You can use this file to keep any notes that you may find useful in the phase test.

For each of the exercises create a project in the relevant directory (see myBeckett if you do not know how to do this).
By the end you will have a complete set of projects for the exercises and a project for the assignment in this repo.
For each project you should create a Readme.md file and show the output of your project.
This portfolio is marked and therefore needs to follow these instructions.

By submitting this work you are confirming that the work in this repo is your own, with all credit given to any sources of help. Such sources might include software tools.
You also confirm that you have read and understood the regulations relating to academic misconduct.
