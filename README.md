# OOP 2024 Portfolio
During each week of the semester we covered new concepts with lectures and practical sessions followed by programs to write at home.
This repository contains said programs and an output log can be found for each program in their respective weekly folders.
Unfornately I do not own the original repo as it was created through git classroom and therefore I have had to reupload them
leaving the commit history unviewable.
